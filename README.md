This is the crystal-analytics API.

Written in Node.js with MongoDB, based off of this [Node task list tutorial](https://github.com/amejiarosario/todoAPIjs), with some cool IP geocoding features provided by [this package](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip).

Crystal Analytics was a pipe dream project to be the first analytics framework for Apple Watch. It never got enough momentum quickly enough, and as such bigger players like Flurry Analytics launched their Apple Watch offerings before this could ever have became a reality.

Open sourced just for the sake of it.
